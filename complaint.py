    Finding the service at the Bank of Mashed Beats less than desireable, you decide to speak with the manager of B.O.M.B.
    You glare at the employee who has given you such rudimentary service and demand that you speak to the manager.
    
    The employee stares back at you blankly. They then slowly open their mouth and explain, "Unfortunately, we do not have a head manager at this time. Our last one just recently decided to take all of his savings a plan a family vacation to the plantet Mercury. Yes, I know it's quite strange, but my attempt to persuade him failed miserably"

    You stare back at the teller confused as all fuck. 
    You have three options:
    1) You could tell the teller that they are the new acting manager and flip them off confidently.
    2) You could storm into the \'Manager\' office on your left and see the truth for yourself
    3) You could turn and walk away. This bank is filled with lunatic shitheads and you\'re too much of a boss (a poor boss, but a boss still) to take this bull.

        The teller raises their eyebrow at you as if your shorter-than-average middle phalange is going to actually make your declaration and their \'new\' position any more real.
        "Yeah, listen...", the teller starts "I don\'t know what\'s up wiht you and trying to make me angry but I highkey don\'t have a soul. I work at a fucking bank for christ\'s sake.
        BUT! I could use the promotion and our old manager was an asshole anyway, sooooooooo you\'re looking a the new acting manager of B.O.M.B.
        They wink, feeling alot more proud of themselves. You can\'t help but feel betryaed because you GAVE them that position, who are they too feel proud about something as illegitmet as getting a job from a customer....you try not to ponder the hyprocity in that statement for too long.

        The new manager gets up from the teller booth and walks towards a door with the word \'Manager\' on it. Hmmmmm, maybe you should have just gone over there first, but it doesn\'t matter at this point. 
        They are gone for approximately 10 minutes before they walk out with a new golden badge with their name on it.
        I guess the manager is just special like that....
        They come back around to face you outside of the booth.
        "Alright," they begin, "let\'s get down to business."

        You look at the new manager. You are amazed that such a simpleton as yourself has so much power...maybe you should use this incredible ability to persuade elsewhere, maybe your crush will say yes to going out.
        But forget about that right now, you have business to take care of. 
        You have two options
        1) Follow the new manager and successfully enter your complaint. You made them so they will probably listen and take your concerns into consideration.
        2) Use your incredbily persuasive abilities to get a personal teller at B.O.M.B, this will definitely come in handy...personal transactions, no lines, just pure bliss and easy banking (something that will never exist in modern society).

            "I just have a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west," you state casually to the manager
            They look at you quizically. "Uhh what? We aren\'t fleeting anywhere. What the fuck are you ranting about?"
            "Nothing..." you say underneath your breath, "Anyway, take me to your corridor."

            The smiles and motions for you to follow them. Strangely, the manager leads you past the door with the actual \'Manager\' label on it and into a dark room deep within the office. You had no idea it was actually this large. It looked so small on the outside.
            Eventually you reach a door with a strange orange glow coming out of its cracks. You feel warm... no...hot... it\'s considerably warm back here. You hope that this door is\'t actually a furnace meant for your beautiful bod. 
            The manager turns around and says, "Welcome, we can sit down and speak here" as they turn the doornob. You notice that the doorknob looks incredibly warm...it\'s fucking glowing from all of the heat that its holding. You wonder how the manager is holding it so confidently and without any sense of pain. Maybe their neurons aren\'t on today.
            
            They open the door and you step in to find that it\'s hot as all fuck in there...but not because there is a large furnace...no it\'s just the thermostat. It reads 100 degrees Fahrenheit. You are confused at the heat, but decide not to say anything about it.
            You take a sit in right-most chair in front of the large oak wood desk and brown leather recliner. The managers sits in the recliner and intertwines thier hands. Villanous like...weird.
            "How can I help you this fine afternoon?" The manager smirks at you.

            You have three options:
            1) Attempt to ignore how hot it is in the room. You are wearing your Fav sweater so it\'s probably just you and tell them about your complaints. 
            2) Ask about the goddamn heat. No human should work in these conditions and the manager cannot be working properly with such high temperatures. Quite frankly, you\'re concerned that they are\'t doing okay.
            3) Just get up and leave. You've had enough of B.O.M.B. From their poor services to inconsdiderate temperatures, you just cannot stand to be in such a hostile environment. You shall take your business elsewhere.
