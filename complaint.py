    Finding the service at the Bank of Mashed Beats less than desireable, you decide to speak with the manager of B.O.M.B.

    The employee stares back at you blankly. They then slowly open their mouth and explain, "Unfortunately, we do not have a head manager at this time. Our last one just recently decided to take all of his savings a plan a family vacation to the plantet Mercury. Yes, I know it's quite strange, but my attempt to persuade him failed miserably"

    2) You could storm into the \'Manager\' office on your left and see the truth for yourself
    3) You could turn and walk away. This bank is filled with lunatic shitheads and you\'re too much of a boss (a poor boss, but a boss still to take this bull.

You notice that the doorknob looks incredibly warm...it\'s fucking glowing from all of the heat that its holding. You wonder how the manager is holding it so confidently and without any sense of pain. Maybe their neurons aren\'t on today.

You ponder pulling out your phone and showing pictures of Russell.

This has been a roller coaster of emotion and you just want to cuddle Russell again. He loves you for who you are and he doesn't care how hot or cold it is.
