Welcome to the Bank of Mashed Beats, otherwise known as the BOMB!

While we hope our code is self-explainatory, we wanted to give you a quick(ish) synopsis of our work.

As a reminder, here are the tasks we agreed on for this project:
    Milestone:
        * Allowing users to create accounts (with a name and a PIN)
        * Allowing users to "sign in" and "sign out"
        * Allowing users to check their balance, and deposit and withdraw money
        * Allowing users to transfer money to (but not from) other users
        * One "hidden" feature, like speaking to a manager
    Final Due Date:
        * The bank having multiple different tellers, with different shifts based on time
        * The rest of the side-"quests" and hidden features
        * Saving and restoring data between runs of the program
    Extras:
        * Check stock info with API or make investments

Since we submitted our proposal, our team has come up with quite a few more ways to make our project live up to its reputation of being the bomb (;)). Here is a list of functions that we have implemented:
    * Opening accounts
    * Checking balances, withdrawing money, depositing money, and transfering money
    * Closing accounts
    * Paying tellers based on their number of hours worked and wages
    * Savings and retrieving teller and account information
    * Entering accounts based on either account number and PIN or name, alias, and PIN
    * A BYOA story where you have the opportunity to get hired
    * A BYOA story where you can rob the BOMB (caution is advised)
    * A BYOA story for complaining to the manager (not for young users)
    * Paying tellers
    * Closing early
    * Adding interest to savings accounts
    * Checking different stock information with the Alpha Vantage API
    * Closing the bank automatically
    * Randomly picking a teller and updating their hours after the bank closes
    * Plus additional information validators and helper functions

We have even more to add, like additional input error catching, but we are very proud of our progress thus far. We had an amazing time in your class this semester and we hope that you love our project and have an amazing time back home!
